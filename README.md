# !!FORGE ABANDONED!!
### I've decided to be a Fabric-only developer, as I make mods as a hobby and I can't keep up with both mod loaders while still having fun. However, if anyone wants to continue development for the forge version, you may either make your own mod that credits mine, also feel free to use any of the code on my Github from this project

## This mod gives you the ability to change the visibility of item frames!

All you have to do is sneak and right-click an item frame with an empty hand.
In addition, you can hold an item frame in your hand to make invisible item frames that are nearby visible.
This mod is completely server-side, so you can easily use it on your own server.

If you find any bugs with the mod, please let me know using the issue reporter on the GitHub repo.
You may also use mod this in your modpack.
